This workspace is a multi-page static portfolio for a Senior Technical Product Manager, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Use a modern, dark, glassmorphism-inspired design with parallax, hover, and animated effects. All code must be framework-free and deployable to GitHub Pages. Prioritize accessibility, performance, and clean, maintainable code.
